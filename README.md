#Phase 1 Project

A fairly simple front-end that displays salary information and history of the company.

### How to Use
There's three ways to interact, one of which is only available if certain conditions are met. The company name, when clicked reveals a brief history of the company. While the "Estimated annual pay:" text, using a "mouseover" event, shows an alert of what the top engineer salary is. When the very last company name is clicked (Flatiron), a submit function is built which requires the code `0451`, which the resets the cards.
