# Phase One Project

### Introduction

The frontend is a fairly simple website build. Five *cards* which display the *name* of a given tech company, it's *logo*, and lastly it's *annual entry pay*. 

Credit to [professor-ben](https://github.com/professor-ben) for the css code used to make the cards, however modified:
```
.card {
  text-align: center;
  border: grey solid 1px;
  padding: 1rem;
  width: 15rem;
  height: 25rem;
  display: inline-grid;
  margin: 1rem 2rem;
  box-shadow: 3px 4px #e04b52
}
```
